# Coordinate Gradient Descent Method

The notebook **CGD Implementation.ipynb** is the entry point to execute the method.  

The **src** directory contains the implementation of the method.  

The example problems are located in **src/problems**:  
* **cuter**: Utilization of the CUTEr functions. Requires installing **PyCUTEest** and **CUTEst**, L1 regularization.
* **easy**: A simple problem.
* **lr_gen_l1**: Linear regression for classifying a type of cancer. Uses a large dataset and L1 regularization to activate the weights of a few genes.
* **more_eps**: Implementation of the EPS function from Moré, L1 regularization.
* **more_trig**: Implementation of the TRIG function from Moré, L1 regularization.
* **rosenbrock**: Rosenbrock function, a problem with boundary constraints.
